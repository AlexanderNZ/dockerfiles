This is a simple image based on ubuntu 16.04, that contains an installtion of miktex.

The purpose of this image is to provide a stable build environment for command line usage of the xelatex package.

I personally, am using this package as part of an automated latex document creation pipeline. You may have other uses!

One remaining problem: speed up latex compilation by precaching packages. Have a solution in mind easy enough, but mpm is running in to problems. no need to fix them now. This is a reminder to future me.
